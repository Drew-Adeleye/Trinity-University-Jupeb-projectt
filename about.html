                    <h3>Introduction</h3>
                    <p>The Joint Universities Preliminary Examinations Board (JUPEB) is a national 
                        examinations body approved by the Federal Government of Nigeria in December 
                        2013. It was formally established in April 2014 by a consortium of ten (10) 
                        partnering universities led by the University of Lagos.</p>
                    <p>The board has the responsibility of conducting common and standard examinations 
                        for the candidates, who have been exposed to a minimum of one-year approved 
                        courses in the different Universities's Foundation and/or Diploma Programmes 
                        and are seeking Direct Entry admissions into University courses at the 200 
                        Level in Nigerian and partnering foreign universities.</p>
                    <p>
                        The first of such examinations was conducted in August 2014 and successful 
                        candidates were admitted into 200 Level by JAMB based on recommendations 
                        from the universities. With effect from 2015, JUPEB Examinations will hold 
                        in June annually.
